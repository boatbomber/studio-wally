# Studio Wally

Studio Wally is a plugin for Roblox Studio that lets you browse, install, and update [Wally](https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally) packages all from in studio.

This plugin is intended to be used by projects that aren't managed by Rojo.

This plugin relies on the experimental [Rojo headless API](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/pull/639) to connect to a server for syncing the packages in.
The headless API is currently not available in the main branch of Rojo, and must be installed from a fork, which is available on the [Roblox Library](https://www.roblox.com/library/11092943149/Rojo-Boatly).
